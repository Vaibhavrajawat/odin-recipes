      <h2><strong>Detailed Steps</strong></h2>
      <strong>Preparing Chole:</strong>
<ul>
    <strong>Cook the Chickpeas:</strong><br>
        Drain and rinse the soaked chickpeas. Boil them with enough water until soft (you can also use a pressure cooker). Set aside.</li><br><br>

    <strong>Making the Gravy:</strong><br>
        Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and bay leaf.<br>
        Add chopped onions and saut√© until golden brown.<br>
        Stir in ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Cook for a few minutes.<br>
        Add tomato puree and cook until the oil separates from the mixture.<br>
        Add chole masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, and coriander powder. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li><br><br>
        <strong>Combine and Simmer:</strong><br>
        Add the cooked chickpeas to the pan. Mix well.<br>
        Add water as needed to adjust the consistency of the gravy. Let it simmer for 15-20 minutes.<br>
        Stir in garam masala and amchur powder. Adjust salt to taste.</li><br><br>

    <strong>Garnish:</strong><br>
        Garnish with fresh cilantro.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Preparing Bhature:</strong>
<ul>
    <strong>Make the Dough:</strong>
        In a bowl, mix all-purpose flour, semolina, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt.<br>
        Add yogurt and mix. Gradually add water to knead a soft dough. Cover and let it rest for 1-2 hours.</li><br>

        <strong>Shape and Fry:</strong>
        Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into a flat disc (about 1/4 inch thick).<br>
        Heat oil in a deep frying pan. Fry the Bhature until golden brown and puffed. Drain on paper towels.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Serving:</strong><br>
